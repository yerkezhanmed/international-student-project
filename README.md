Where Do International Students in the U.S. Come From?
This project explores international student enrollment patterns in the United States using data from Kaggle. I analyzed trends by region, field of study, and visa type from 2000â€“2022. I used wrangling, visualization, and linear regression to understand which factors influence enrollment. As an international student myself, I was curious about what the data would reveal.
